### Objective

* To manipulate an SVG using ES6 JavaScript and make an interactive baseball quiz.

### Scope

This project will focus on:
* the use of Bootstrap for layout
* Manipulating an SVG
* ES6 javascript for handling events on an SVG


### Requirements
* I want a "quiz" using this SVG, for each of the baseball positions.
* I want all the postions to be shuffled up.
* I want to be prompted for a position, one at a time.
* I want to click on the SVG in response to the prompt for the position.
* I want to be presented with immediate feedback (incorrect, correct answer).
* I want to go through each prompt and be given some sort of 'complete' screen when I'm done.
* The SVG comes with text on each position. You should have a way for, in dev/debug mode, these texts are visible, but in production, I should be able to hide these.

### Stretch goals
* Make the circle (clickable position marker) turn Green for success
* Red for incorrect, 
* gray (or hidden) if it's already been guessed correctly.

#### Technical Constraints

* Do not use CSS, do as much as you can with Bootstrap.
* Do not use additional Javascript libraries (React, Vue, jQuery)
* Any solutions from Stack Overflow (or other resources) should be cited in the comments of the project
